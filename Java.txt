Java Q&A:
1.can we override start method in java?
Yes, we can override the start() method of a Thread class in Java. 
We must call the super. start() method to create a new thread and need to call run() method in that newly created thread.

2.Can we override a static method? 
No, we cannot override static methods because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at 
runtime and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time. 

3.can we override private method in java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. 
If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method,
this is known as method hiding.

4.can we override main method in java?
What happens if we override main method in Java?
Java main() Method Overloading

Without the main() method, JVM will not execute the program. Syntax: public static void main(String args[])

5.can we create static constructor in java?
No, we cannot define a static constructor in Java,
If we are trying to define a constructor with the static keyword a compile-time error will occur.
In general, static means class level.
A constructor will be used to assign initial values for the instance variables.
